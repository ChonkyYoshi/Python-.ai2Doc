[Instructions]
Extract = - Choose the files you want to process using the 'Browse' button.
    - Customise the Extraction behaviour by checking the options as needed:
    - Skip Hidden will not extract any hidden TextFrame
    - Skip Locked will not extract any locked TextFrame
    - Export PDF will decide if the script exports the prepped file to PDF.
    NOTE: This is turned on by default.
    - Click on 'Start'
    - The Script will automatically launch an instance of Adobe Illustrator and open all the selected files one by one and extract all the text it can find following the settings you chose.
    - It will save all extracted strings from each file in a bi-column file called 'Strings_<ai file name>.docx'.
    If applicable, it will append 'NO_HIDDEN' and/or 'NO_LOCKED' if the option was ticked.
Import = - Choose the ai files you want to import text into and their translated .docx files containing the translations using the 'Browse' buttons for each field.
    - Customise the Extraction behaviour by checking the options as needed:
        - Export PDF will decide if the script exports the translated file to PDF.
    NOTE: This is turned on by default.
    - Merged .ai file are saved as Merged_<.ai file name> and exported to PDF by default.
    IMPORTANT: the translated .docx file NEEDS to be named the exact same as it was when it was imported with a dash followed by the 4-letter LP code appended at the end. If the name has NO_HIDDEN or NO_LOCKED in it, the script will intelligently skip those during import.
    So if you extracted text from 'Example.ai' using the 'Skip Hidden' feature and translated it into German, the translated docx file should be named 'Strings_Example.ai_NO_HIDDEN-de-DE.docx'.
    If the script can't match a ai file to its corresponding .docx file, it will be skipped.
Pseudo = - Choose the .ai files you want to pseudotranslate using the 'Browse' button.
    - Customise the Extraction behaviour by checking the options as needed:
        - Skip Hidden will not pseudotranslate any hidden TextFrame
        - Skip Locked will not pseudotranslate any locked TextFrame
        - Export PDF will decide if the script exports the pseudotranslated file to PDF.
    NOTE: This is turned on by default.
    - The program will automatically launch an instance of Adobe Illustrator then proceed to pseudotranslate all the text it can find in the file following the settings you chose.
    - Pseudotranslated .ai file are saved as Pseudo_<.ai file name> and exported to PDF by default.
IMPORTANT: This step DOES NOT create a Word file.
